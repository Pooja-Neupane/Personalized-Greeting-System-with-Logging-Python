# 💬 Personalized Greeting System in Python

This project is a simple Python program that demonstrates the power of **functions**, **closures**, and **decorators** through a personalized greeting system. It also includes logging functionality to track when greetings are generated.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Generate personalized greetings using **closures**
- 🧠 Modular design with **functions**
- 🧾 Execution logging using **decorators**
- 🧪 Easy to extend for new users or greeting formats

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Concept     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Function    | Modular logic using reusable blocks |
| Closure     | Inner function that remembers its lexical scope |
| Decorator   | Wraps functions to add logging behavior |

---

## 📝 How It Works

- A **decorator** (`logger_decorator`) is used to log the function calls and completions.
- A **closure** (`greeting_creator`) returns a function customized with the desired greeting.
- The main function `generate_and_display_greeting()` ties everything together by creating a greeting function and printing the message.
